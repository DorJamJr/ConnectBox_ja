This line added in Branch_1 version of the code


New text file to play with

This will be the base code committed to the master branch...

This code shows up in my local github desktop, but not in the master right now...
Next, I'll use the "Publish Branch" button (top line of the github desktop) to push this branch to github... where it becomes the "master" branch.
(Note that I've saved it locally, so the edits show up when I choose the "Changes" tab in the left pane of GitHub Desktop )
(Note also that the various previous saves show up in the History tab)
"History" shows previous committs to local git rep
"Changes" shows deltas for current save vs last committ
   SO I think a committ happens when you write a description and committ locally.

See if I can summarize.
- a local repo is created when we do an initial pull (?) (essentially a git clone action)
- an ansible edit/save of a file in the local repo leaves the file visible to other editors, but not saved in the local git repo (ie, file saved but not part of the repo yet)
- Filling in change info (left pane of GitHub Desktop) followed by "Commit to master" (button push) pushes the changes into the local repo
(so file is visible to local editors AND part of the local repo... )
- When we do a "commit" to local, the results show in the History tab and the "Changes" tab shows empty (ie, all the changes are now committed)



A change made in a branch (ie, saved but not committed) will be "stashed" so it can be retrieved later
A change made in a branch, saved and also committed will become part of the repo

So then I can publish this branch to github...

So I added a file (File_2.txt) in branch_1... and did a commit...

I now have an option for a Pull request (I think the option is available because branch_1 is published on github.com)
SO a "Pull request" is the vehicle to start the process of combining MY branch (branch_1) with the master branch. Doing a Pull request (I think) will let me specify collaborators with whom I share my proposed changes, ask for comments, and ultimately let me roll branch_1 into master.
Note that a Pull request is a pull from github.com (not my local repo) so before a Pull request I need to push MY repo up to github.com

---->>> I ADDED THIS IN THE RESOLVE CONFLICTS DIALOG ON GITHUB ---- 

After Pull request to merge branch_1 into master... not clear how to add participants to the list of those who can comment on the merge..??
ANSWER... "In the pull requests tab on your github repo, click on the request you would like to merge"
If there are no conflicts, you will get a button to do the merge
If there ARE conflicts, you will get a "resolve conflicts" button...

When you click that button, you will see the diffs between the conflicting file and can then do
an edit on screen at github.com .... then click the "Mark as Resolved" button... then click the 
"Commit Merge" button (upper left)
There will follow two more button presses (optional comment) to
commit the merge to the master

AHA... in the GitHub Desktop tool, clicking on the branch chooser dialog, selecting master gives option at bottom to select branch (from the list) that you want to merge into master...


Just found a way to merge from the github desktop tool
It is fast, but seems to not set up for review by others


added in branch_1
