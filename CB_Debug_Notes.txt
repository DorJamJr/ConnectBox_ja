# 12/29  CM4 box   HS
## Problem: A complete CM4 box is either dropping or failing to bring up the wifi channel with CB SSID
This actually happened on two boxes. The first was a "ConnectBox" labeled CM4 with a badly damaged HAT board 
 with a shorted power fet, burned antenna coax, broken battery connection clad, etc. Not pretty. After fixing the other broken stuff (use copper foil folded over to make battery terminal connection to board) the wifi wasn't working. I pulled the 8812 module and replaced it. That fixed the problem (for a while). During a burn in, the wifi went intermittent. It worked for a couple hours then stopped. That felt like a software problem, but I needed to deliver the unit so I delivered it to Kirk (in the intermittent condition).

Kirk gave me a failed unit which had been returned to him. This was a CM4 with a "TheWell" label. The wifi 
 wasn't working on this one. I found the two wifi coax cables from the 8812 were routed under the ethernet
 connector which wasn't allowing the board to sit properly in the case. I did a re-route on those cables and then reassembled and the wifi worked. (Also removed the hard solder connect of battery - terminals into the board. Cut the termnials to stubs and then used copper foil to make connection from board to battery stubs. Much better.) Using the 121922 code, the wifi was working and then stopped. Hardware looked good and I considered that the 8812 module might have failed, but then tried the latest code change to /etc/network/interfaces file (replace "$FACE" with "wlan1" in 4 places). After reboot, the wifi is working. Going to let it run for a while to see if is reliable.

 The unit (running modified /etc/network/interfaces code) has run about 6 hours now. If it continues to run
  I will build a new image.
