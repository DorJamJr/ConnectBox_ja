This file contains notes re: build, use, etc of images for RockPi CM3

010523
Searching for images for the CM3, I came to the conclusion that I would need to build my own. (Search for "Radxa CM3 Getting Started" gave link to Radxa site with description on building a Debian image.) This morning I came across 
   https://github.com/radxa/debos-radxa/releases/tag/20230101-1010
which has several images, including:
   radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye-xfce4-arm64-20230101-1153-gpt.img.xz   

It appears that these images are compiles of 1/3/23 for various Radxa products (zero, zero2,
rock-3a, rock-3b, rock-3c, rock-4c, rock-4c-plus, etc). For the CM3 product there was only the
debian-bullseye and the ubuntu-focal versions, of which the debian-bullseye is the most interest
(which I downloaded to the 2021 MBP). Of interest for the rock-4c+ board set, there is:
   rock-4c-plus-debian-bullseye-xfce4-arm64-20230101-1230-gpt.img.xz
which I also downloaded.

I burned the radxa-cm3-io-debian-bullseye... image to an 8 GB uSD and installed the uSD and 
CM3 card into the ROCK IO board. I powered the board with a 12V 1000mA wall wart I had available
and powered up. It worked. (YEAH!) When I put that same uSD and CM3 into my CM4 HAT and used normal
power (charger + 2 batteries) it did not boot. Not sure what that is about.

To get ssh running, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to add the "PermitRootLogin yes" line then do a 
'sudo service ssh restart'.

Use the menu pulldown for "Settings" to change the appearance of the terminal. 
Also in Settings change the screen to 1920x1280 (16:9) to get reasonable screen look.
